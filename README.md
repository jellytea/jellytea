I am working on:

- Compilers
- Digital hardware design
- DIY STM32-based applications with KiCad
- Productivity and automation tools

I am stilling developing my blog system, I don't know when I will finish it.

I have lost all trace of my past about coding during 2017-2020 due to account deletion.

### lost+found

***The less you have, the more you fear losing.***

Writing about my past, is my way of making peace with my past.

Here are the ideas and repos I've **dropped in the past**:

- **2018 On-EasyAccess**<br/>A failed xml-based database program that failed in a competition held by the city.
- **2018 LangVM Project**<br/>Motivated to create a purely functional high-level VM as an alternative to the JVM, and provide native compilation support at the same time.<br/>The thing beyond my mind is: it has similar inspiration and motivation with LLVM's. I didn't know about this thing that time. [(The last paragraph in Page 3, Chapter Perface)](https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781782166924)
- **2018 Lava, Oops, Cheese** programming languages etc<br/>VM-level assembly, high-level programming languages designed for LangVM.
- **2019 Ketchup**: a simple graphics engine based on OpenGL.
- **2019 Divine Comedy and Reality**<br/>Make the story and three realms of Divine Comedy into a game. I found that I have no enough ability to do it that time and now. **I hope someone/producer can do it for me.**

Which I **picked up again** from the list above:
- 2023 [LangVM Project](https://github.com/langvm)

I has joined GitHub in **2017** in fact and [here](https://github.com/jellytea/jellytea/blob/main/lost-and-found/mailbox.jpg) is the evidence (earlier mails are gone).

The deletion of my past accounts and activities is a **great regret** for me.
